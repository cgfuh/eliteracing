<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
  Here are some details around parts of the site that have extra functionality.
  Specifically, the documentation for the API is here.

<h3>API</h3>

<p>
  This documents the first version of the website's API. It will expand with
  time, but has a working "courses" section now. New fields may be added with
  time, but any breaking changes (such as a renamed field or 
  different/incompatible structure) will result in a new API version.
